# Node.js REST API Blog

This is a Node.js-based backend for a simple blog application with REST API endpoints. It provides functionality for users to sign up, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts.

## Features

- REST API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts
- Built with Node.js and Express for a scalable backend
- Authentication and authorization features for secure data access
- Follows best practices for code quality and maintainability
- Fully tested for reliability and stability

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (or any other database of your choice for storing blog data)
- Authentication and authorization libraries (JWT)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB or other database connection in `config/database.js`.
4. Set up any necessary environment variables in `config/keys.js` (e.g., JWT secret, database connection URL).
5. Start the server using `npm run start` or `node server.js`.
6. The REST API will be running at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

- Use a REST client (e.g., Postman, curl, etc.) to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
- Refer to the API documentation in the codebase for available API endpoints and their usage.
